# Automatic_Medicine_Dispenser

This is a solution to a project in a hackthon, where the problem was to build a smart automatic medicine dispenser which will help in reducing the stress, mental and physical exertion by facilitating the patient with a very seamless and hassle-free experience. It also reduces the miscommunication or the communication gap between the patient and the pharmacists.
